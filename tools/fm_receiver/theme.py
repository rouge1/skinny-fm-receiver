"""The one place the window gets its colours and type from.

Copied from the RF bench toolkit (``/data/python/SDR/apps/theme.py``, commit
20c76e4) so this app wears the same three themes - Slate, Reading Room and
Walnut - without depending on that repository. The notes below are that
file's own; "the launcher" and "the dialogs" are the toolkit's windows. Here
only :func:`flowgraph_qss` is used, through ``style.apply_window_theme``.

The palette, the type scale and the faces live here, and every window
reads them - ``apply_launcher_theme``, ``apply_dark_theme`` and
``apply_flowgraph_theme`` in ``apps/utils.py`` through :func:`launcher_qss`,
:func:`dialog_qss` and :func:`flowgraph_qss`. So a dialog and the window
it opens read as one app, and a colour edited here moves in all of them.

**This module imports nothing but the standard library at module level**,
so ``scripts/test_theme.py`` can check every theme with no Qt and no
display; :func:`load_fonts` is the one function that needs Qt and it
imports inside itself.

Qt Style Sheets look like CSS but are not, and some of what the launcher
draws has no QSS equivalent at all - variables, cropping a picture to its
box, desaturating it, ``letter-spacing``, drop shadows and anything that
moves. Those are done in Python, in ``RFbenchToolkit.py``; everything that
*is* expressible lives here.

    # face with no bold of its own is then thickened by FreeType instead:
    # measured, a third more ink on Archivo SemiBold and on Limelight. So

#: 4.5:1 on a panel, ``ink_3`` at least 3:1, the status colours at least
#: 4.5:1 on the ground and the panel, because the receivers set their lock
#: line in them. ``scripts/test_theme.py`` holds each theme to that.
