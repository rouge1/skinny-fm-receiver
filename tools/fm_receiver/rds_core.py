"""RDS / RBDS decoding core — DSP back end and protocol layer.

Kept free of GNU Radio and Qt so it can be exercised offline against a recorded
capture and reused by the live receiver.

Copied unchanged from the RF bench toolkit (``/data/python/SDR/apps/rds_core.py``,
commit 20c76e4). Why it decodes the way it does is written up in that
repository's ``devnotes/rds.md``; read it before changing anything here.

Signal chain (the parts above the FM demodulator):

    MPX ──▶ mix down by the 57 kHz subcarrier ──▶ low-pass ──▶ integrate-and-dump
                    ▲                                              │
              3 × pilot phase                                      ▼
                                                        biphase symbol ──▶ bits

The 57 kHz RDS subcarrier is locked to the third harmonic of the 19 kHz stereo
pilot, and the 1187.5 bit/s clock is the pilot divided by 16. So one PLL lock on
the pilot yields both the carrier phase and the symbol timing, coherently — no
separate carrier or clock recovery loop is needed.

Bits then run through the (26,16) shortened cyclic code: offset words mark which
of the four blocks in a group we are looking at, and the code corrects any
single error burst up to 5 bits long.

    ``pilot_ref`` is a unit-amplitude complex tone locked to the 19 kHz pilot
    (from GNU Radio's PLL block live, or a software PLL offline). Its cubed
    phase is the 57 kHz subcarrier and its phase/16 is the bit clock.

    The offset between the pilot phase and the symbol boundary is *not* a
    constant: the bit grid is anchored at whatever pilot phase the first sample
    happened to have, so it differs every run and with any filter delay ahead of
    this class. It is therefore measured from the signal (see ``_pick_tau``)
    rather than hard-coded - getting it wrong costs every single bit.
